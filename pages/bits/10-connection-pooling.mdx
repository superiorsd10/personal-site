# connection pooling

it is a practice of maintaining a cache of reusable database connection, so instead of opening and closing connection repeatedly, we can reuse the existing ones only.

<br></br>

**how connection pooling works?**

1. **initialization:** a pool of database connections is created and maintained when the application starts

2. **borrowing:** whenever application needs a database connection for performing some operations, it borrows a connection from connection pool

3. **returning:** once the application is done with operations, it returns the borrowed connection back to the pool

<br></br>

**key components**

- **connection pool manager:** it manages the lifecycle of connections including creation, borrowing, and returning

- **connections:** actual database connections that are maintained in the pool

<br></br>

**pros**

- reduces the time and resources needed to establish connections thereby increasing performance

- limits the number of simultaneous database connections, preventing resource exhaustion

- supports higher loads and improves application scalability

<br></br>

**best practices**

- the pool size must be configured based on the application load and database capacity

- the pool usage should be regularly monitored to identify and resolve bottlenecks

- it should be ensured that the borrowed connections are returned to the pool to avoid leaks and resource exhaustion
