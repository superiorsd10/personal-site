# bloom filters in web caching

while implementing web caching one of our key goal is optimizing the performance and one effective tool for this purpose is bloom filters

<br></br>

**what are bloom filters?**

a bloom filter is a space-efficient, probabilistic data structure used to test whether an element is a member of a set 

when checked it can return false positives but never false negatives, it means that a bloom filter can definitely say an element is not in a set but can only say an element might be in a set or might not be 

<br></br>

**key properties**

- uses less memory compared to other data structures
- both insertions and queries are performed in constant time

<br></br>

**how bloom filters improve web cache performance?**

web caching means storing copies of resources to serve future requests faster, let's see how bloom filters improves web cache performance

- they quickly checks if a resource might be in the cache before accessing the disk resulting in lesser disk reads

- faster lookups lead to reduced response times for cache hits

- optimizes memory and processing power usage by reducing the load on caching mechanisms

**practical implementation in CDNs and browser caching**

- **CDNs**

    they can be used to manage the cache at edge servers

    - when the client makes a request, the edge server uses a bloom filter to check if the request resource might be in the cache

    - if the bloom filter returns a positive result, the server then checks the cache

        - if hits, the resource is served from the cache
        - if miss, the resource is fetched from the origin server and then stored in the cache

    - the bloom filter is updated to include the new resource

similarly it can be used to manage the local cache as well
